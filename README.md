## Test task
> Aim of the exercise: Convert integer numbers into roman numerals.
### Step 1:
A front-end form will allow the user to input a integer number between 0 and 100. When
submitting the form, the user will receive the conversion of this number into roman numerals.
So for example, if a user inputs “9” and submits the form, the page should display “IX”.
The actual conversion will be done on the back-end side through an AJAX request.
Conversion rules can be found on the following page:

### Step 2:
Once your conversion is working well. You will create a second version of the code in which
the result of the conversion is sent to the client through a Sever Side Event.
More information about the SSE can be found on the following page:

*Each step of the exercise will be done on a separate branch.
